# Projects we like

- **DDR controller for the DE2-115 - start with Edgar's work, port it to Chisel, and adapt for DE2-115**
- **A 'normal' NoC with shared address transactions, but still using TDM. With either only write, or read and write**
- **Network-on-chip in Chisel**
- **Argo NoC in Chisel**
- **Hardware support for locking (CAS or LL/SC)**
- **A normal NoC with standard wormhole routing**
- **On shared SPMs - maybe change of ownership - there was a paper idea on this**
- **CMP with shared L2 cache and cache coherence to L1**
- **Round robin arbiter with rate control (for mixed real-time systems)**
- **Read in Argo (Pull)**
